In order to mess around with the game you will need to have unity installed. 
The "button" is coded in C#.

This is our first version of ThroughThePipes
This will be a side scrolling game where you are required to get through the pipes without touching them. 

What we have completed so far is:
Visuals
Hit boxes
Score boxes
Applied Physics 
ButtonTap which makes our bird look down when falling and go up when we click

What we want to have completed for our second version:
Scrolling
Random Spawning
Score Keeping
Start Page
Restart Page
Game Over Page
Sounds
